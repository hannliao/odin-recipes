    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Your bananas are turning brown! Don't throw them away - turn them into a <em>scrumptious</em> banana bread. 
        This chocolatey banana loaf is perfect for any occasion: eat a slice for breakfast or bring the whole loaf to a party to share with friends.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this banana bread, I recommend using overripe bananas, since they tend to be sweeter. 
        Feel free to use any kind of chocolate chips, but I like using <strong>mini</strong> semi-sweet chocolate chips (they spread out the chocolate taste more evenly!).
